Slope failures pose serious risks comparable to natural disasters. In this study, we evaluated various machine learning algorithms—including ensemble, boosting, bagging, and traditional models—for slope stability classification. Using AutoGluon, the weighted ensemble method achieved 97.5% accuracy, outperforming others. Feature importance analysis revealed that unit volume weight and internal friction angle were the most influential parameters. This research significantly advances slope stability assessment using automated machine learning.
