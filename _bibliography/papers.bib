	abstract = {Poor air quality has various detrimental physical and mental effects on human health and quality of life. In particular, PM2.5 air pollution has been associated with cardiovascular and respiratory problems. Therefore, air quality management is an essential issue for densely populated cities to reduce or prevent the adverse effects of air pollution. Considering this, reliable models for predicting pollution levels for pollutants like PM2.5 are critical tools for decision-making. For this purpose, this study presents three kinds of deep learning (DL) algorithms (LSTM, RNN, and GRU) that utilize a time-windowing strategy to predict the hourly concentration of PM2.5 in the Istanbul metropolitan. The models were trained and tested using large data sets that envelope air quality parameters (PM2.5, SO2, NO, NO2, NOX, and O3) and meteorological factors (temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and air pressure) for about five years. The experimental results demonstrate that the LSTM+LSTM model performs significantly better with an R2 of 0.98 and 0.97 at the significance level (p {\textless} 0.05) for training and test sets compared to other deep learning algorithms. In addition, data for one year from several stations located in nine different districts of Istanbul were used to evaluate the proposed model's generalization ability. As a result, the proposed LSTM+LSTM model has a good generalization ability with an R2 accuracy rate of 0.90 (p {\textless} 0.05) and above for all stations and can be used for non-linear, non-stationary multidimensional time series data. Furthermore, the results were compared to other studies in the literature; it was found that the proposed LSTM+LSTM model performed better in predicting PM2.5 concentrations.},

	abstract = {Since air pollution negatively affects human health and causes serious diseases, accurate air pollution prediction is essential regarding environmental sustainability. Although conventional statistical and machine learning methods have been widely used for air quality forecasting, they have limitations in finding nonlinear relations and modeling sequential data. In recent years, deep learning methods such as long short-term memory, recurrent neural networks, and gated recurrent units have been successfully applied in several research areas, including time-series forecasting. In this study, deep learning algorithm is employed to predict the PM2.5 dataset, including air pollutants (NO, NO2, NOX, O3, PM2.5, SO, and SO2) and meteorological features (wind speed, wind direction, and air temperature) in Istanbul metropolitan. Deep learning algorithms have many hyperparameters such as learning and dropout rate, the number of hidden layers and units in each hidden layer, activation function, loss function, and optimizer that need to be optimized in order to achieve optimal training performance. Therefore, a genetic algorithm-based hyperparameter optimization approach is proposed to find the best parameter combination. The prediction results of deep learning algorithms are compared with default hyperparameters and random search algorithms to confirm the efficacy of the genetic algorithm approach. The proposed method outperforms the other configurations, with the MSE error reduced by 13.38\% and 55.30\% for testing performance, respectively. The experimental results revealed that genetic algorithms are promising and applicable in hyperparameter optimization of deep neural network models, especially in air quality forecasting.},

Planning can become complicated in sectors with many different products such as tire production. This study focuses on the bottleneck problem caused by a machine called a Quadruplex Extruder in a tire factory. With this machine, rubber is extruded and transformed into a tread material product, which is critically important in some essential tire features, such as low rolling resistance and brake distance. This study aims to minimize the set-up times in production by optimizing the manufacturing order of the products produced in a quadruplex extruder machine using the Ant Colony Algorithm (ACA), a well-known metaheuristic method to solve polynomial optimization problems. In addition, the second version of the Lin–Kernighan–Helsgaun (LKH-2) algorithm was adapted to this problem. Manually prepared, LKH-2 and ACA-produced schedules were compared in terms of global efficiency. As a result, it has been shown that ACA can provide fast and suitable solutions for decision makers in production planning.},

That is why in this study the authors offer a statistical method to overdue problems which belongs to big data.

	abstract = {One of the most critical issues in machine learning is the selection of appropriate hyper parameters for training models. Machine learning models may be able to reach the best training performance and may increase the ability to generalize using hyper parameter optimization (HPO) techniques. HPO is a popular topic that artificial intelligence studies have focused on recently and has attracted increasing interest. While the traditional methods developed for HPO include exhaustive search, grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization; meta-heuristic algorithms are also employed as more advanced methods. Meta-heuristic algorithms search for the solution space where the solutions converge to the best combination to solve a specific problem. These algorithms test various scenarios and evaluate the results to select the best-performing combinations. In this study, classical methods, such as grid, random search and Bayesian optimization, and population-based algorithms, such as genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization, are discussed in terms of the HPO. The use of related search algorithms is explained together with Python programming codes developed on packages such as Scikit-learn, Sklearn Genetic, and Optuna. The performance of the search algorithms is compared on a sample data set, and according to the results, the particle swarm optimization algorithm has outperformed the other algorithms.},

	abstract = {Because the alternative process plans have significant contributions to the production efficiency of a manufacturing system, researchers have studied the integration of manufacturing functions, which can be divided into two groups, namely, integrated process planning and scheduling (IPPS) and scheduling with due date assignment (SWDDA). Although IPPS and SWDDA are well-known and solved problems in the literature, there are limited works on integration of process planning, scheduling, and due date assignment (IPPSDDA). In this study, due date assignment function was added to IPPS in a dynamic manufacturing environment. And the studied problem was introduced as dynamic integrated process planning, scheduling, and due date assignment (DIPPSDDA). The objective function of DIPPSDDA is to minimize earliness and tardiness (E/T) and determine due dates for each job. Furthermore, four different pure metaheuristic algorithms which are genetic algorithm (GA), tabu algorithm (TA), simulated annealing (SA), and their hybrid (combination) algorithms GA/SA and GA/TA have been developed to facilitate and optimize DIPPSDDA on the 8 different sized shop floors. The performance comparisons of the algorithms for each shop floor have been given to show the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithms used. In conclusion, computational results show that the proposed combination algorithms are competitive, give better results than pure metaheuristics, and can effectively generate good solutions for DIPPSDDA problems.},

On the one hand, the rapidly increasing population phenomenon, the existence of natural resources that are running out has made it necessary to seek new solutions for humanity. The solution put forward in this framework is the understanding of sustainable development, which can be summarized as ensuring that natural resources are transferred to future generations without completely consuming them. The priority in sustainable development approach has been the sustainability of the natural environment. With the increasing awareness of the international community and states, production systems and processes are revised and transition to green practices that will minimize environmental damage has rapidly gained importance. A traditional supply chain is a one-way process that involves productionrelated activities from raw material procurement to delivery of the final product. Due to environmental requirements affecting production operations today, an increasing emphasis is placed on the development of environmental management strategies for the supply chain. In this study, green approaches, and green supply chain management (GSCM) are considered conceptually, and the green activities implemented and the obstacles in front of them are evaluated. A general perspective is put forward to ensure and maintain the green supply chain.},

The study identiﬁes potential distribution center locations and uses the BestWorst Method (BWM) to determine criteria such as population, distance to major highways and airports, public transportation availability, natural disaster risk, and suitable infrastructure. BWM is used to assign weights to each criterion and rank them based on their importance. The Additive Ratio Assessment (ARAS) method is then used to evaluate potential distribution center locations based on the established criteria. Disaster management experts and academicians provide their opinions through an online and face-to-face survey. Based on the results, Adapazarı is identiﬁed as the most suitable district for a humanitarian logistics distribution center. The study highlights the importance of considering multiple criteria when selecting distribution center locations and provides a framework for using multi-criteria decision-making methods in logistics planning. Disaster managers and policymakers can use the results to make informed decisions about the location of humanitarian logistics distribution centers.},

Çok boyutlu ilişkilerin tahminini gerektiren finansal zaman serisi modelleri için çeşitli istatistiksel yöntemler geliştirilmiştir. Ancak günümüzde büyük verilerin kaydedilmesi, analiz edilmesi ve anlamlı bilgiye dönüştürülmesi kolaylaştığından dolayı finansal tahmin geliştirmede makine öğrenmesi algoritmalarının kullanımı özellikle son yıllarda artmıştır. Bu çalışmada, Borsa İstanbul endeksinde metal ana pazarında işlem gören EREGL hissesine ait veriler zaman serisi yöntemleri ile analiz edilmiş ardından ARIMA ve derin öğrenme modelleri ile tahmin edilmiştir. Geliştirilen derin öğrenme yönteminde veri ön işleme aşamaları, özellik çıkarımı çalışmaları ve farklı zaman çerçeveleri ile tahmin performansı iyileştirilmiştir. Derin öğrenme algoritmalarının zaman serisi çalışmalarında kullanılabilmesi için zaman gecikmelerinden oluşan bir çerçeve kullanılmalıdır. Bu çalışmada, farklı zaman gecikmeleri için senaryolar denenmiş ve performans kıyaslaması ARIMA modelleri ve uzun-kısa vadeli bellek (LSTM), geçitli tekrarlayan ünite (GRU) ve özyineli sinir ağları (RNN) algoritmalarını kullanan derin öğrenme modelleri arasında gerçekleştirilmiştir.

            Financial time-series data are nonlinear, complex, influenced by many economic factors, and are difficult to predict. Several traditional statistical methods have been developed for financial time series modeling. However, because it is now easier to record, analyze, and transform big data into meaningful information, the use of machine learning algorithms in financial forecast development has increased in recent years. In this study, the data of EREGL stocks, which are among the stocks traded in the main metal market in the Borsa İstanbul index, are analyzed using time series methods and then modeled using ARIMA and deep models. In the developed deep learning method, the prediction performance improved with data preprocessing stages, feature extraction studies, and different time windows. For deep learning algorithms to be used in time-series studies, a framework of time delays must be used. In this study, scenarios for different time delays and performance comparisons are performed between ARIMA models and deep learning models using long-short term memory (LSTM), gated repeating unit (GRU), and recursive neural network (RNN) algorithms. Experimental studies demonstrate that the RNN algorithm has a better prediction performance than the others and predicts with an average accuracy of 93\% on the test dataset.

	abstract = {Process planning, scheduling, and due date assignment functions are the three fundamental manufacturing functions. Traditionally, these functions were examined independently in production systems. The integrated communication of these functions is one of the most efficient ways to ensure high customer satisfaction, nonetheless, in the technological and competitive climate of today. Although these functions have been integrated in academic research over the past few decades, in practice, they are still generally performed sequentially and independently. Although limited research exists that integrates the three functions, this study introduces delivery as a fourth function. The objectives of this study are to make a significant contribution to the literature by demonstrating the integrated nature of four functions in manufacturing systems, with a view to increasing efficiency compared to traditional solutions. The study also seeks to investigate the impact of incorporating the delivery function. Customers are not viewed as being equal, as is the case with many of the other integrated studies that can be found in the literature; rather, each client is given special consideration. Each of the four job shops is unique and has a different number and location of customers. The study solves the complex problem by utilizing simulated annealing and evolutionary strategies algorithms. Both method-based and job shop-based comparisons are made, and the results show which methods perform better in each job shop. The results demonstrate that the integrated system offers an improvement of approximately 50\% compared to independent systems. Furthermore, the study found that, across all four job shops, the evolutionary strategies (ES) outperformed simulated annealing (SA) in terms of results.},

This study presents a machine-learning approach for predicting and modeling electrode and workpiece wear on an electrical discharge machining (EDM) machine. In the experimental design, EDM of CuCrZr and Cu electrodes of AISI P20 tool steel was carried out at different pulse currents and duration levels. In addition, CuCrZr and Cu electrodes used in the experiment were cryogenically treated at a predefined degree for multiple periods and then tempered. This study employed machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, and k-nearest neighbors to model the EEW of cryogenically treated electrodes made of mold steels. The results were compared according to the coefficient of determination (R2), adjusted R2, and root mean squared error. As a result, the decision trees outperformed the other algorithms with 0.99 R2 performance. This study provides valuable insights into the behavior of EEW in mold steel electrodes and could be used to optimize the manufacturing process and extend the lifespan of the electrodes.},

	abstract = {Social media usage has significantly increased, allowing people to freely express their wishes and complaints through these platforms. Consequently, this has caused a significant increase in data, providing information about users, companies, services, and products. However, making sense of this data with human effort is impossible, necessitating various methods. Sentiment analysis is one such method that helps us understand customers’ thoughts on products and companies. In this study, the emotions of e-commerce site users were analyzed using Turkish Twitter data. Text mining techniques were applied to Twitter data, which were analyzed and classified as positive and negative. It was found that 66.9\% of the tweets were negative, and 33.1\% were positive. The classification results were evaluated using precision, Recall, and F1 criteria. As a result of the evaluation, the sensitivity criterion for negative comments was 94\%, and the precision criterion for positive comments showed the highest value with 86\%. When looking at the F1 score, 85\% for negative comments and 69\% for positive comments were calculated. The accuracy rate of the model was found to be 79\%.},

	abstract = {The primary purpose of the existence of companies is to ensure continuity, to satisfy their employees and customers, as well as to make a profit. The most effective way to achieve customer satisfaction is to send the goods and services requested by the customer on time. To send the orders at the desired time, it is necessary to estimate how many orders will be in which periods. Because of the many factors that affect the sales demand, accurate and reliable estimates are required. Dollar rate, GDP, number of car parks, number of vehicles produced, number of exports, interest rate, CPI, and PPI are taken as factors affecting the engine sales demand. In this study, the sales volume of the engine bearing, one of the automotive sub-industry products, was calculated using the multiple regression model and several methods in time series analysis and these methods were compared with each other.},

In this study, traffic accidents occurred in city of Sakarya were analysed. The related data of this study were obtained from the Sakarya Provincial Police Department. There are 139 accident-related features in the data set. In order to classify the data set in this study, important features of the data set were initially determined. Secondly, decision trees, the classification algorithm frequently used in the literature, were used to discover more accurate information and relationships from the data set to achieve the classification goals. Performance evaluation of decision tree algorithm was made according to the classification performance shown by the results.},
