	abstract = {One of the most critical issues in machine learning is the selection of appropriate hyper parameters for training models. Machine learning models may be able to reach the best training performance and may increase the ability to generalize using hyper parameter optimization (HPO) techniques. HPO is a popular topic that artificial intelligence studies have focused on recently and has attracted increasing interest. While the traditional methods developed for HPO include exhaustive search, grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization; meta-heuristic algorithms are also employed as more advanced methods. Meta-heuristic algorithms search for the solution space where the solutions converge to the best combination to solve a specific problem. These algorithms test various scenarios and evaluate the results to select the best-performing combinations. In this study, classical methods, such as grid, random search and Bayesian optimization, and population-based algorithms, such as genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization, are discussed in terms of the HPO. The use of related search algorithms is explained together with Python programming codes developed on packages such as Scikit-learn, Sklearn Genetic, and Optuna. The performance of the search algorithms is compared on a sample data set, and according to the results, the particle swarm optimization algorithm has outperformed the other algorithms.},

   abstract = {Finding optimal solutions to production planning and scheduling problems is crucial for surviving in a competitive environment and meeting customer expectations over time. Planning can become complicated in sectors with many different products such as tire production. This study focuses on the bottleneck problem caused by a machine called a Quadruplex Extruder in a tire factory. With this machine, rubber is extruded and transformed into a tread material product, which is critically important in some essential tire features, such as low rolling resistance and brake distance. This study aims to minimize the set-up times in production by optimizing the manufacturing order of the products produced in a quadruplex extruder machine using the Ant Colony Algorithm (ACA), a well-known metaheuristic method to solve polynomial optimization problems. In addition, the second version of the Lin–Kernighan–Helsgaun (LKH-2) algorithm was adapted to this problem. Manually prepared, LKH-2 and ACA-produced schedules were compared in terms of global efficiency. As a result, it has been shown that ACA can provide fast and suitable solutions for decision makers in production planning.},

   abstract = {Since air pollution negatively affects human health and causes serious diseases, accurate air pollution prediction is essential regarding environmental sustainability. Although conventional statistical and machine learning methods have been widely used for air quality forecasting, they have limitations in finding nonlinear relations and modeling sequential data. In recent years, deep learning methods such as long short-term memory, recurrent neural networks, and gated recurrent units have been successfully applied in several research areas, including time-series forecasting. In this study, deep learning algorithm is employed to predict the PM2.5 dataset, including air pollutants (NO, NO2, NOX, O3, PM2.5, SO, and SO2) and meteorological features (wind speed, wind direction, and air temperature) in Istanbul metropolitan. Deep learning algorithms have many hyperparameters such as learning and dropout rate, the number of hidden layers and units in each hidden layer, activation function, loss function, and optimizer that need to be optimized in order to achieve optimal training performance. Therefore, a genetic algorithm-based hyperparameter optimization approach is proposed to find the best parameter combination. The prediction results of deep learning algorithms are compared with default hyperparameters and random search algorithms to confirm the efficacy of the genetic algorithm approach. The proposed method outperforms the other configurations, with the MSE error reduced by 13.38% and 55.30% for testing performance, respectively. The experimental results revealed that genetic algorithms are promising and applicable in hyperparameter optimization of deep neural network models, especially in air quality forecasting.},

   abstract = {Because the alternative process plans have significant contributions to the production efficiency of a manufacturing system, researchers have studied the integration of manufacturing functions, which can be divided into two groups, namely, integrated process planning and scheduling (IPPS) and scheduling with due date assignment (SWDDA). Although IPPS and SWDDA are well-known and solved problems in the literature, there are limited works on integration of process planning, scheduling, and due date assignment (IPPSDDA). In this study, due date assignment function was added to IPPS in a dynamic manufacturing environment. And the studied problem was introduced as dynamic integrated process planning, scheduling, and due date assignment (DIPPSDDA). The objective function of DIPPSDDA is to minimize earliness and tardiness (E/T) and determine due dates for each job. Furthermore, four different pure metaheuristic algorithms which are genetic algorithm (GA), tabu algorithm (TA), simulated annealing (SA), and their hybrid (combination) algorithms GA/SA and GA/TA have been developed to facilitate and optimize DIPPSDDA on the 8 different sized shop floors. The performance comparisons of the algorithms for each shop floor have been given to show the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithms used. In conclusion, computational results show that the proposed combination algorithms are competitive, give better results than pure metaheuristics, and can effectively generate good solutions for DIPPSDDA problems.},

   abstract = {Poor air quality has various detrimental physical and mental effects on human health and quality of life. In particular, PM2.5 air pollution has been associated with cardiovascular and respiratory problems. Therefore, air quality management is an essential issue for densely populated cities to reduce or prevent the adverse effects of air pollution. Considering this, reliable models for predicting pollution levels for pollutants like PM2.5 are critical tools for decision-making. For this purpose, this study presents three kinds of deep learning (DL) algorithms (LSTM, RNN, and GRU) that utilize a time-windowing strategy to predict the hourly concentration of PM2.5 in the Istanbul metropolitan. The models were trained and tested using large data sets that envelope air quality parameters (PM2.5, SO2, NO, NO2, NOX, and O3) and meteorological factors (temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and air pressure) for about five years. The experimental results demonstrate that the LSTM+LSTM model performs significantly better with an R2 of 0.98 and 0.97 at the significance level (p  0.05) for training and test sets compared to other deep learning algorithms. In addition, data for one year from several stations located in nine different districts of Istanbul were used to evaluate the proposed model's generalization ability. As a result, the proposed LSTM+LSTM model has a good generalization ability with an R2 accuracy rate of 0.90 (p  0.05) and above for all stations and can be used for non-linear, non-stationary multidimensional time series data. Furthermore, the results were compared to other studies in the literature; it was found that the proposed LSTM+LSTM model performed better in predicting PM2.5 concentrations.},

   abstract = {For centuries, humanity has seen nature as an unlimited resource, despised it, they polluted it. Hence, that caused environmental problems. On the one hand, the rapidly increasing population phenomenon, the existence of natural resources that are running out has made it necessary to seek new solutions for humanity. The solution put forward in this framework is the understanding of sustainable development, which can be summarized as ensuring that natural resources are transferred to future generations without completely consuming them. The priority in sustainable development approach has been the sustainability of the natural environment. With the increasing awareness of the international community and states, production systems and processes are revised and transition to green practices that will minimize environmental damage has rapidly gained importance. A traditional supply chain is a one-way process that involves productionrelated activities from raw material procurement to delivery of the final product. Due to environmental requirements affecting production operations today, an increasing emphasis is placed on the development of environmental management strategies for the supply chain. In this study, green approaches, and green supply chain management (GSCM) are considered conceptually, and the green activities implemented and the obstacles in front of them are evaluated. A general perspective is put forward to ensure and maintain the green supply chain.},
