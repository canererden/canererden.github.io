I am currently serving as a Senior Researcher at the [AI Research and Application Center](https://yapayzeka.subu.edu.tr/en) within Sakarya University of Applied Sciences ([SUBÜ](https://www.subu.edu.tr/en)), located in Sakarya, Turkey. Additionally, I hold the position of Associate Professor in the [Faculty of Technology](https://tf.subu.edu.tr/en/anasayfa), specifically in the [Department of Computer Engineering](https://bm.subu.edu.tr/en) at SUBÜ.

Prior to my current roles, I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Industrial Engineering from Istanbul Commerce University in 2010, followed by a Master of Science degree in Industrial Engineering from Istanbul University in 2013. Subsequently, from 2013 to 2019, I worked as a Research Assistant in the [Industrial Engineering Department](https://ie.sakarya.edu.tr/en) at Sakarya University, where I also completed my Ph.D. under the guidance of [H. İbrahim Demir](https://hidemir.sakarya.edu.tr/en). My doctoral thesis focused on the integration of process planning, dynamic scheduling, and due date assignment functions in a job shop environment.

My research interests span several areas within the realm of computational sciences, including:
- data science and data mining, 
- machine learning, 
- operations research, 
- meta-heuristic algorithms. 

I am passionate about exploring innovative approaches and techniques to address complex challenges in these fields.
