## Welcome to my Personal Website

I am currently serving as a Senior Researcher at the [AI Research and Application Center](https://yapayzeka.subu.edu.tr/en) within Sakarya University of Applied Sciences ([SUBÜ](https://www.subu.edu.tr/en)), located in Sakarya, Turkey. Additionally, I hold the position of Associate Professor in the [Faculty of Technology](https://tf.subu.edu.tr/en/anasayfa), specifically in the [Department of Computer Engineering](https://bm.subu.edu.tr/en) at SUBÜ.

Prior to my current roles, I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Industrial Engineering from Istanbul Commerce University in 2010, followed by a Master of Science degree in Industrial Engineering from Istanbul University in 2013.
