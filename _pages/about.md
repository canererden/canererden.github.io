I am currently serving as a Senior Researcher at the [AI Research and Application Center](https://yapayzeka.subu.edu.tr/en) within Sakarya University of Applied Sciences ([SUBÜ](https://www.subu.edu.tr/en)), located in Sakarya, Turkey. Additionally, I hold the position of Associate Professor in the [Faculty of Technology](https://tf.subu.edu.tr/en/anasayfa), specifically in the [Department of Computer Engineering](https://bm.subu.edu.tr/en) at SUBÜ.

Prior to my current roles, I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Industrial Engineering from Istanbul Commerce University in 2010, followed by a Master of Science degree in Industrial Engineering from Istanbul University in 2013. Subsequently, from 2013 to 2019, I worked as a Research Assistant in the [Industrial Engineering Department](https://ie.sakarya.edu.tr/en) at Sakarya University, where I also completed my Ph.D. under the guidance of [H. İbrahim Demir](https://hidemir.sakarya.edu.tr/en). My doctoral thesis focused on the integration of process planning, dynamic scheduling, and due date assignment functions in a job shop environment.

In the 2024–2025 academic year, I completed a TÜBİTAK-funded postdoctoral research project at the [College of Computing](http://www.coc.gatech.edu/) of the Georgia Institute of Technology, under the supervision of [Prof. Ling Liu](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/ling-liu). This work focused on advanced topics in data science and intelligent systems, further expanding my expertise in computational methods and interdisciplinary applications.

My research interests span several areas within the realm of computational sciences, including:
- data science and data mining, 
- machine learning, 
- operations research, 
- meta-heuristic algorithms. 

I am passionate about exploring innovative approaches and techniques to address complex challenges in these fields. This website serves as a platform to showcase my research, projects, and professional contributions. Here, you can find detailed information about my work, access my publications, and read my blog posts where I share insights and updates on various topics related to my field.
