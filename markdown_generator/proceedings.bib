	abstract = {The Meri{\c c} River is a strategically important river between Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey. Meri{\c c} River is joined by the rivers of Tunca and Arda in Edirne and continues to the path of Ergene by adding its arm. In recent years, the Meri{\c c} River is raised with the flood, which has caused important environmental problems affecting especially Edirne [1]. Therefore, it has been important to know the possible flood of the Meri{\c c} River. In this study, an artificial neural network model was developed using flow measurement data between 2005-2011 years in {\.I}psala, Plovdiv, Svilengrad and Kiri{\c s}hane gauging stations on the Meri{\c c} River.},
