Meri{\c c} River is joined by the rivers of Tunca and Arda in Edirne and continues to the path of Ergene by adding its arm. In recent years, the Meri{\c c} River is raised with the flood, which has caused important environmental problems affecting especially Edirne [1]. Therefore, it has been important to know the possible flood of the Meri{\c c} River. In this study, an artificial neural network model was developed using flow measurement data between 2005-2011 years in {\.I}psala, Plovdiv, Svilengrad and Kiri{\c s}hane gauging stations on the Meri{\c c} River.},

	abstract = {Traditionally process planning, scheduling and due-date assignment functions are applied sequentially and separately. Since these three functions effect each other and if we don't integrate then they will become poor input for downstream and global performance will be poor. In these competitive era we have to be competitive also. Integrating these functions will improve global performance. In this study we investigated the benefit of integration. We tested different integration level. First we looked at unintegrated results and later we integrated due-date assignment with process planning and finally we integrated these two functions with ATC (Apparent Tardiness Cost) Dispatching. In this study we observed that as integration level increases the solution becomes better. Integrating due-date assignment with process planning improves global performance and if we integrate ATC dispatching with these two functions then we get the best performance. In addition to integration level we also compared benefit of search techniques, especially genetic (directed) search. We compared ordinary solutions (initial populations) with results of random search and genetic search (after some certain number of iterations). We tested three shop floors which are small, medium and large shop floor. We observed that search is always better than ordinary solutions and genetic search outperformed random (undirected) search. At this study every customer has weight and they are scheduled by considering weights to improve performance value.},

Integration of the production functions has been studied in the literature. In this context, there are hundreds of works on integrated process planning and scheduling (IPPS) and scheduling with due date assignment (SWDDA) problems. In this paper, we extend the existing literature works on integrated process planning, scheduling, and due date assignment (IPPSDDA) using a hybrid search algorithm. Since the scheduling problem is in the NP-Hard problem class without any integration, the integrated problem is even harder to solve. This study focuses on the integration of these functions. Sum of weighted tardiness, earliness, and due date related costs are used as a penalty function. Random search and hybrid meta-heuristics are used to solve the integrated problem. We used hybrid and random search techniques while solving the integrated problem. Full integration with hybrid search is found as the best combination. So hybrid search outperformed random search and ordinary solutions were very poor compared to the search results.},

	abstract = {Rough sets theory which was developed by Pawlak (1982) is a mathematical method that tries to find solutions by analyzing the uncertain data. One of the most important advantages of rough sets theory is that it can analyze data by using less information than the other methods. Due to this reason, in this study, it is aimed to classify the traffic accidents that took place in the USA in 2011 according to their occurrence reasons, to analyze the classified data and to discover useful knowledge from the analyzed data. Rough sets theory which is an application of data mining methodology used for knowledge discovery enables us to analyze the accident reasons in more than one dimension and also enables us to make comments without ignoring any of the accident reasons. Since it is aimed to extract decision rules as a result of the study and the relationships between the data cannot be identified using statistical methods, rough sets theory is used. In this way, all the accident reasons were taken into account at the same time. ROSETTA software was used to analyze accident data in order to reduce redundant data and extract decision rules. We think that the main contribution of this study is that the results of this study can aid the related authorities and decision makers in taking the necessary precautions to reduce and prevent the traffic accidents.},

	abstract = {Electromagnetic pollution is rapidly spreading as a new environmental pollution due to the rapid development of communication technology and leads to some health problems mentioned in the literature. Hence, electromagnetic pollution is considered to be a new environmental problem, which can be in the form of danger and risk dimension according to the degree of exposure to electromagnetic radiation.In order to reduce the environmental risks of electromagnetic radiation,Risk perception is an important step in determining community awareness. This study conducted a questionnaire consisting of 21 question packages over 107 people working in Bursa Nilufer Municipality. In this survey study, the level of electromagnetic radiation risk perception from base station and the factors related to this level were determined.In this study, the rules of association were obtained by applying the apriori algorithm to the questionnaire. The study was analyzed in terms of educational status, age, gender and occupation of the participants.},

	abstract = {Although there are only a few works on IPPSDDA problem, there are hundreds of works on IPPS and SWDDA problems. Conventionally three important manufacturing functions, process planning, scheduling and due date assignments are performed independently. High interrelation between these three functions forces us to integrate these functions. As we observed with this research as integration level increases overall performance becomes better. That is why we studied integration of these three functions. Since only scheduling problem is NP-Hard problem and integrated problem is even harder to solve, we used random and hybrid searches as metaheuristics to solve the integrated problem. Marginal benefits of earlier random iterations are higher compared to the later iterations. Later directed search becomes better in terms of marginal benefits and at this research we combined power of random and simulated annealing searches and used hybrid search as a solution technique. As a penalty function we used sum of weighted tardiness, earliness and due date related costs.},

	abstract = {Although traditionally process planning, scheduling, and due date assignment are three important manufacturing functions performed separately and sequentially. There are numerous works on IPPS (Integrated Process Planning and Scheduling) and SWDDA (Scheduling with due date assignment) and some works on IPPSDDA (Integrated process planning, scheduling, and due date assignment) problems. There are high interrelations between these three functions and they should be handled concurrently to improve global performance. Although according to classical view only tardiness should be punished, according to JIT philosophy both earliness and tardiness should be punished. Since nobody wants far due dates we should also penalize due date related costs and at this study, we penalized all of the weighted earliness, tardiness and due date related costs. Although in the literature due dates are assigned without taking into consideration of weights of each job, we assigned due dates according to the importance of the customers. More important customers get closer due dates. This provides substantial improvements in penalty function terms. In this study, we used hybrid and random searches as solution techniques. Since marginal improvements of random search is high at the beginning and later genetic search is a more proper tool in searching we combined power of random and genetic searches and we used hybrid search as solution techniques.},
