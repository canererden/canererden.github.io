	abstract = {Decision of supplier selection has a crucial importance for a firm to succeed. Liquefied Natural Gas? (LNG) is a crucial alternative to ensure the safety of natural gas supply in today's conditions, especially for the state of natural gas supply security. LNG supplier selection constitutes the most important key point of this process. This study aims to make the selection of the best LNG natural gas supplier for Turkey using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods according to the current conditions. For this purpose, expert opinions, activity reports and literature reviews were made to determine main and sub criteria. AHP method is applied by using Expert Choice Software and TOPSIS was analyzed with Microsoft Excel for the best supplier choice. In addition, it has been shown that which criteria brings which alternatives forward, which criteria are decisive in the result and which are not decisive.},

Although integrated process planning and scheduling, and scheduling with due date assignment problems are popular research topics, only a few works address the integration of these three functions. This work focuses on the integration of process planning, WMS scheduling, and WPPW due date assignment. Another novelty of this work is the use of a weighted due date assignment. In the literature, due dates are generally assigned without considering the importance of customers. However, in this study, more important customers get closer due dates. Typically, only tardiness is punished, but the JIT philosophy punishes both earliness and tardiness. In this study, all weighted earliness, tardiness, and due date related costs are penalized. As no customer desires distant due dates, such distant due dates should be penalized. In this study, various levels of integration of these three functions are tested and genetic search and random search are compared both with each other and with ordinary solutions. Higher integration levels are superior, while search is always useful. Genetic searches outperformed random searches.},

We use axiomatic design principles to solve facility layout problem of a furniture company by using practical information taken from company official. Some taken information which are maintenance, visual control, quality (Judoka), flexibility, volatility about layout problem is not numerical. Therefore, it is necessary to use fuzzy principles in order to get better results. To optimize facility layout can improve operations and process of the company which provides better lead time and more customer satisfactions.

Fuzzy set theory introduced by Zadeh tried to cope with complexity caused by uncertainty and lack of information. In this study, a fuzzy linear programming model was constructed using data from a factory which produces cloth types in textile industry. Solution of the model gives the amount of production for each cloth type in order to get optimal solution for profit maximizing.

In this study we observed that as integration level increases the solution becomes better. Integrating due-date assignment with process planning improves global performance and if we integrate ATC dispatching with these two functions then we get the best performance. In addition to integration level we also compared benefit of search techniques, especially genetic (directed) search. We compared ordinary solutions (initial populations) with results of random search and genetic search (after some certain number of iterations). We tested three shop floors which are small, medium and large shop floor. We observed that search is always better than ordinary solutions and genetic search outperformed random (undirected) search.

	abstract = {Studies have confirmed that PM10, defined as respirable particles with diameters of 10 $\mu$m and smaller, has adverse effects on human health and the environment. Various estimation methods are employed to determine the PM10 concentration using historical data on controlling PM10 air pollution, early warning, and protecting public health and the environment. The present study analyses different Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models that can predict hourly PM10 concentration. In parallel, the study also investigates the effectiveness of the data preprocessing and feature selection (DPFS) process on the prediction accuracy of the LSTM models. For this purpose, three different LSTM models, namely Vanilla, Bi-Directional, and Stacked, were developed. Then, a comprehensive data preprocessing stage is used to eliminate missing and erroneous data and outliers from realworld raw data, and a feature selection process is applied to extract unnecessary features. The LSTM models consider three air quality parameters, including SO2, O3, and CO, and three meteorological factors, including relative humidity, wind direction, and wind speed. The prediction performances of the LSTM models are compared using the RMSE, MAE and R2 performance index according to whether DPFS is used in the models or not. As a result, when the DPFS process was applied, the proposed LSTM models achieved high prediction performance and can be used to predict hourly PM10 concentrations. Overall, the DPFS process significantly enhanced the developed LSTM models{\textquoteright} prediction performance. Furthermore, the proposed model might be a useful tool for city administrators to make decisions and improve air quality management efforts.},

Traditionally, several analytical inferences were made for the prediction of soil liquefaction. However, it is necessary to use machine learning methods to establish nonlinear relationships of soil physical characteristics and develop an accurate classification model. In this study, the applicability of seven different machine learning algorithms; decision trees, logistic regression, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, stochastic gradient descent, random forest, and artificial neural network, were investigated on a data set obtained from field experiments (Standard Penetration Test) on soils in Adapazari region after the 1999 earthquake. Performance metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score, and receiver operating characteristic evaluated algorithms. As a result of experimental studies, the decision tree algorithm performed best on the dataset, with an overall accuracy of 90\%. The decision tree model provides an easy and effective tool for evaluating ground liquefaction potential to decision-makers. As a result of the decision tree study, it was observed that the mean grain size (D50) soil feature has the most significant effect on the lique- faction potential.},

On the one hand, the rapidly increasing population phenomenon, the existence of natural resources that are running out has made it necessary to seek new solutions for humanity. The solution put forward in this framework is the understanding of sustainable development, which can be summarized as ensuring that natural resources are transferred to future generations without completely consuming them. The priority in sustainable development approach has been the sustainability of the natural environment. With the increasing awareness of the international community and states, production systems and processes are revised and transition to green practices that will minimize environmental damage has rapidly gained importance. A traditional supply chain is a one-way process that involves productionrelated activities from raw material procurement to delivery of the final product. Due to environmental requirements affecting production operations today, an increasing emphasis is placed on the development of environmental management strategies for the supply chain. In this study, green approaches, and green supply chain management (GSCM) are considered conceptually, and the green activities implemented and the obstacles in front of them are evaluated. A general perspective is put forward to ensure and maintain the green supply chain.},

	abstract = {Poor air quality has various detrimental physical and mental effects on human health and quality of life. In particular, PM2.5 air pollution has been associated with cardiovascular and respiratory problems. Therefore, air quality management is an essential issue for densely populated cities to reduce or prevent the adverse effects of air pollution. Considering this, reliable models for predicting pollution levels for pollutants like PM2.5 are critical tools for decision-making. For this purpose, this study presents three kinds of deep learning (DL) algorithms (LSTM, RNN, and GRU) that utilize a time-windowing strategy to predict the hourly concentration of PM2.5 in the Istanbul metropolitan. The models were trained and tested using large data sets that envelope air quality parameters (PM2.5, SO2, NO, NO2, NOX, and O3) and meteorological factors (temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and air pressure) for about five years. The experimental results demonstrate that the LSTM+LSTM model performs significantly better with an R2 of 0.98 and 0.97 at the significance level (p~{\textless}~0.05) for training and test sets compared to other deep learning algorithms. In addition, data for one year from several stations located in nine different districts of Istanbul were used to evaluate the proposed model's generalization ability. As a result, the proposed LSTM+LSTM model has a good generalization ability with an R2 accuracy rate of 0.90 (p~{\textless}~0.05) and above for all stations and can be used for non-linear, non-stationary multidimensional time series data. Furthermore, the results were compared to other studies in the literature; it was found that the proposed LSTM+LSTM model performed better in predicting PM2.5 concentrations.},

Although IPPS and SWDDA are well-known and solved problems in the literature, there are limited works on integration of process planning, scheduling, and due date assignment (IPPSDDA). In this study, due date assignment function was added to IPPS in a dynamic manufacturing environment. And the studied problem was introduced as dynamic integrated process planning, scheduling, and due date assignment (DIPPSDDA). The objective function of DIPPSDDA is to minimize earliness and tardiness (E/T) and determine due dates for each job. Furthermore, four different pure metaheuristic algorithms which are genetic algorithm (GA), tabu algorithm (TA), simulated annealing (SA), and their hybrid (combination) algorithms GA/SA and GA/TA have been developed to facilitate and optimize DIPPSDDA on the 8 different sized shop floors. The performance comparisons of the algorithms for each shop floor have been given to show the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithms used. In conclusion, computational results show that the proposed combination algorithms are competitive, give better results than pure metaheuristics, and can effectively generate good solutions for DIPPSDDA problems.},

	abstract = {Since air pollution negatively affects human health and causes serious diseases, accurate air pollution prediction is essential regarding environmental sustainability. Although conventional statistical and machine learning methods have been widely used for air quality forecasting, they have limitations in finding nonlinear relations and modeling sequential data. In recent years, deep learning methods such as long short-term memory, recurrent neural networks, and gated recurrent units have been successfully applied in several research areas, including time-series forecasting. In this study, deep learning algorithm is employed to predict the PM2.5 dataset, including air pollutants (NO, NO2, NOX, O3, PM2.5, SO, and SO2) and meteorological features (wind speed, wind direction, and air temperature) in Istanbul metropolitan. Deep learning algorithms have many hyperparameters such as learning and dropout rate, the number of hidden layers and units in each hidden layer, activation function, loss function, and optimizer that need to be optimized in order to achieve optimal training performance. Therefore, a genetic algorithm-based hyperparameter optimization approach is proposed to find the best parameter combination. The prediction results of deep learning algorithms are compared with default hyperparameters and random search algorithms to confirm the efficacy of the genetic algorithm approach. The proposed method outperforms the other configurations, with the MSE error reduced by 13.38\% and 55.30\% for testing performance, respectively. The experimental results revealed that genetic algorithms are promising and applicable in hyperparameter optimization of deep neural network models, especially in air quality forecasting.},
