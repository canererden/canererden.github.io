Emerging Advances and Applications in Intelligent Manufacturing and Service Systems


In modern industry, intelligent manufacturing and service systems have emerged as key technologies for improving productivity, efficiency, and quality. Advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, additive manufacturing, cloud manufacturing, digital twin, blockchain, and big data analytics integrate intelligent systems to create smarter, more agile manufacturing and service systems (Aheleroff et al., 2021). As a result, they are revolutionizing how products are designed, produced, and delivered while enhancing the customer experience and improving the overall business performance. Many theoretical and practical approaches, including smart sensors (Meijer et al., 2018), smart buildings (Majeed et al., 2021), smart cities (Dey et al., 2018), and governance to facilitate the development of human-to-human, human-to-machine, machine-to-machine systems with high quality and integration level have been developed in the literature (Aheleroff et al., 2020). The most important challenges of recent AI studies are the applications that have better scalability, security, privacy, context awareness, adaption, extensibility, sustainability, availability, and configurability features (Osman, 2019).

This special issue (SI) welcomes emerging advances and applications in intelligent manufacturing and service systems with high-quality contributions addressing related theoretical and practical aspects. SI also invites original research papers, review articles, and case studies that address the topics of the conference 12th International Symposium on Intelligent Manufacturing and Service Systems (IMSS23) (https://imss.sakarya.edu.tr):

- ​Intelligent manufacturing systems and Industry 4.0
- Smart factory design and optimization
- Predictive maintenance and quality control
- Service design and delivery in intelligent service systems
- IoT-based service systems
- Intelligent supply chain and logistics management
- Data analytics and machine learning in manufacturing and service systems
- Human-machine collaboration in intelligent systems
- Applications of intelligent manufacturing and service systems in various domains, such as healthcare, transportation, retail, and energy
